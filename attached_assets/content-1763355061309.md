Version: v0.3.x

OpenChoreo is a comprehensive, open-source Internal Developer Platform (IDP) designed for platform engineering (PE) teams who want to streamline developer workflows and deliver Internal Developer Portals without having to build everything from scratch.

OpenChoreo orchestrates many CNCF and other projects to give platform teams a strong head start, you can use it as-is, or tailor it to fit your own internal developer platform vision.

## Why OpenChoreo? [​](https://openchoreo.dev/docs/\#why-openchoreo "Direct link to Why OpenChoreo?")

Kubernetes gives you powerful primitives like Namespaces, Deployments, CronJobs, Services, and NetworkPolicies—but they are too low-level for most developers.

This creates a gap: **Platform engineers are left to build the real platform,** defining higher-level APIs for developers and integrating tools for security, CI/CD, observability, and operational guardrails.

**OpenChoreo fills that gap.** It provides all essential building blocks of an IDP, including:

- **High-level APIs** for modeling cloud-native applications
- A **Control Plane** that understands and enforces these APIs with GitOps support
- A **built-in CI system**
- An **opinionated Data Plane** with runtime enforcement of design-time semantics
- Built-in **security**, **networking,** and **observability** integrations

With OpenChoreo, we are bringing the best ideas of [WSO2 Choreo](https://choreo.dev/) (an IDP as a Service) to the open-source community. WSO2 Choreo is designed not just to automate software delivery workflows, but to support engineering best practices: enforcing architecture standards, promoting service reuse, and integrating API management and observability.

## OpenChoreo Components [​](https://openchoreo.dev/docs/\#openchoreo-components "Direct link to OpenChoreo Components")

OpenChoreo is made up of several key components that work together to deliver a comprehensive IDP.

- **Control Plane** \- The orchestration layer that watches developer and platform APIs, validates configurations, and translates them into Kubernetes-native and cloud-native infrastructure.
- **Developer API** \- Simplified, self-service interfaces for developers to model, deploy and manage the full SDLC of cloud-native applications, without needing to understand platform internals.
- **Platform API** \- Declarative interfaces used by platform engineers to configure and manage the OpenChoreo installation.
- **Data Plane** \- The execution environment for applications that is built on Kubernetes and extended with Cilium, Envoy Gateway, and other CNCF tools. The Data Plane is where runtime semantics are enforced.
- **CI Plane** \- A built-in CI engine powered by Argo Workflows. It builds the container images, runs tests, and publishes artifacts. It is an optional plane.
- **Observability Plane** \- Out-of-the-box visibility with logs, metrics and traces, using tools like Prometheus, Fluent Bit and OpenSearch.

Learn more about how these components fit together in the [OpenChoreo Architecture](https://openchoreo.dev/docs/overview/architecture/) section.

## Current Status [​](https://openchoreo.dev/docs/\#current-status "Direct link to Current Status")

OpenChoreo is currently in **active development**. While the core platform is functional, APIs may change as
we incorporate community feedback. We recommend starting with non-production workloads as you evaluate the platform.

See our [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/openchoreo/projects/4) for upcoming features and the stable release timeline.
